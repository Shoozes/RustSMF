# RustSMF History

This file is the canonical home for completed repo/app work and its durable verification record. Current behavior belongs in `APP_STATE.md`; active work belongs in `TODO.md`; recurring hazards belong in `PITFALL_LEDGER.md`.

## 2026-08-01 — Weight-preview state restoration audit

- Fixed selected-bone weight preview cleanup so it restores the source color attribute and each material's prior `vertexColors` mode instead of forcing materials to `false`.
- Added focused unit coverage for existing source colors, models without source colors, and invalid selected-bone cleanup. The test runner now discovers 41 files and reports 250 passing frontend unit tests.
- Updated `APP_STATE.md`, the frontend test contract, the legacy shader parity map, the pitfall ledger, and `summary_bank.json` to keep the current behavior and source route explicit.

### Verification

- `pwsh -NoProfile -File .\run.ps1 -Task verify`: passed; context, lint, typechecks, build/chunk guards, 250 frontend units, and 9 Rust tests are green.
- Focused weight-preview unit test: 3/3 passed.
- A focused four-case skin browser rerun reached its test bodies but was blocked during managed Chrome teardown by `browserContext.close: spawn EPERM`; the prior complete 55/55 browser run remains the authoritative browser result, and the stale server was cleaned up.

## 2026-08-01 — Follow-up browser and legacy-shader audit

- Corrected the Playwright executable override to use `use.launchOptions`, where Playwright actually consumes it; the managed Windows fallback now runs against an explicitly approved installed Chrome executable without changing app configuration.
- Added a served SVG favicon, reused the viewport IK drag helper in visual coverage, froze animated skin fixtures for deterministic brush sampling, and widened probe points to cover narrow quad-view geometry.
- Audited the old selected-bone weight shaders and recorded their four-slot/HSV behavior alongside the current export-safe vertex-color equivalent. The legacy shader paths remain reference material, not an untracked implementation stub.
- Fixed the workspace-transition IK readiness race: browser telemetry now rejects absent coordinates, and newly mounted target handles refresh their world matrix before raycasting. The focused IK case passed 5/5 repeated runs; the full browser suite passed 55/55.
- Completed the dependency audit with `npm.cmd audit --omit=optional`: 0 vulnerabilities reported.

## 2026-08-01 — Integrity and external FBX compatibility pass

- Replaced the hardcoded frontend unit-test list with deterministic recursive discovery.
- Hardened posed skin-brush sampling, invalid skin diagnostics, cache invalidation, viewport resize cancellation, animation snapshot/controller ownership, and latest-intent load/export timing.
- Added bounded SMF reader/writer sections, counts, strings, numeric/range checks, output preflight, native 256 MiB I/O limits, blocking-task adapters, UNC normalization, explicit CSP, and truthful native header-check wording.
- Added current-head browser regressions for skin cancellation/no-op edits, native export cancellation, indexed geometry, material policy, and independent FBX compatibility.
- Added an independently authored Blender 5.0.0 skinned, textured, animated FBX fixture with provenance and a repeatable external validator. The fixture is intentionally test-only and carries no third-party source asset.
- Corrected FBX export integer-array typing and layer metadata so the vendored binary writer is accepted by Blender as well as Three.js. FBX texture loading now waits on the loader-owned resource manager before attaching the scene and removes unavailable maps before render.
- Updated the local Codex skill pack, pitfall ledger, current-state docs, history, and context routing to remove stale paths and repeated progress prose.

### Verification

- `pwsh -NoProfile -File .\run.ps1 -Task verify`: passed after the final changes.
- `npm.cmd run test:e2e -- --reporter=line` with the process-local `RUSTSMF_PLAYWRIGHT_EXECUTABLE` override: 55/55 passed.
- `npm.cmd run test:visual-strict -- --reporter=line` with the same browser override: 2/2 passed.
- `npm.cmd run tauri:build:smoke`: optimized no-bundle Tauri release executable built successfully.
- Canonical `desktop-smoke`: release build, Rust tests, and native IPC browser coverage passed.
- Blender 5.0.0 validated both the committed independent fixture and the app-exported roundtrip: one mesh, two bones, weighted groups, animation curves, embedded material texture.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
